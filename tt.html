        How to use ?

        <p>
            This server is able to serve your static files. Simply create a project folder along
            <tt>MinimalistWebServer.py</tt>, launch the server and access the right URL. All libraries used are
            built-in inside Python 3; no external dependencies are needed.
        </p>
        <p>You can organize your project folder as you want, but the recommended structure is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
MinimalistWebServer/your_project/
                |-- index.html # or the name you want
                |
                |-- static/
                |         -- css/
                |               style.ss
                |         -- img/
                |               1.png
                |               2.png
                |               3.png
                |         -- js/
                |              index.js
  </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When your project folder is ready, you can run the server with:<br>
                <pre>python3 MinimalistWebServer.py</pre>
                or under Windows:
                <pre>python MinimalistWebServer.py</pre>
                The server listens on port 8080 by default, but you can mention another port when creating the
                server instance. The port number must be of type int. <br>
                Example:<br>
                <pre>server = MinimalistWebServer(port=8000)</pre>
            <li>

            <li>
                Now the server is running, just access the URL displayed in your terminal (localhost
                address + port number).<br> You should see this welcome page, unless you replaced default.html
                with your own.
            </li>

            <li><b>You need to mention your html file in the path, otherwise the server won't find
                    it. For example:</b><br>
                <pre>http://127.0.0.1/your_project/index.html</pre>
            </li>
            <li>That's it, you should be able to see your html file and all the linked static files will be
                served as well.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            By default, Linux does not allow access through the web browser to
            <em>any</em> file apart of those located in <tt>/var/www</tt>,
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html">public_html</a>
            directories (when enabled) and <tt>/usr/share</tt> (for web
            applications). If your site is using a web document root
            located elsewhere you may need to modify your files permissions
            accordingly.
