# Minimalist Web Server

The Minimalist Web Server is a lightweight Python-based web server utilizing the socket module. While simplistic, it offers the functionality to serve static files. This project is intended for educational purposes rather than production use.

## Why ?

The goal of creating this web server was to explore how web servers function and gain a better understanding of the HTTP protocol.By constructing a basic server from scratch, the aim was to grasp fundamental concepts such as handling incoming connections, parsing HTTP requests, and serving responses.

This project serves as a stepping stone to comprehend the workings of sophisticated web servers like Apache or Nginx.
